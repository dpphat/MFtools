\title{Convert a MODPATH pathline file into a simple feature (sf) object composed of linestring features}
\usage{
pth2sf(df = NA, X_off = 0, Y_off = 0, ROT = 0, MAX_TIME = Inf,
  PATH = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{This is the data frame containing the pathline information. If this dataframe is not
present pth2sf will call readpathline using the supplied PATH. The default is NA.}

\item{X_off}{This is the global X coordinate offset.}

\item{Y_off}{This is the global Y coordinate offset.}

\item{ROT}{This is the rotation angle in units of degrees.}

\item{MAX_TIME}{is the maximum pathline travel time to be printed. This defaults to Inf.}

\item{PATH}{This is the full file path to the pathline file. 
When PATH is NA and df is not supplied this function will look in the current working 
directory for the pathline file.}
}
\description{
This function takes as an argument a MODPATH pathline tibble (as generated using the readpathline
function) and converts the contents into an sf object. The pathline can be converted to real-world 
coordinates using coordinate offsets and rotations. The pathline can also be modified by applying a 
MAX_TIME limit that will only show pathlines that are less than or equal to the
threshold time limit (MAX_TIME).
