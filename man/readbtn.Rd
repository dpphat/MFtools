\item{dX}{Cell Width Along Columns} 
\item{X}{Cell Center Coordinate in the Model Coordinate System} 
\item{dY}{Cell Width Along Rows}
\item{Y}{Cell Center Coordinate in the Model Coordinate System}
\item{TOP}{Top Elevation of Layer 1}
\item{TRANS} {Data frame composed of LAY, ROW, COL, dZ, PRSITY, ICBUND, SONC, where these values are defined as follows:}
\item{dZ}{Layer Thicknesses}

\item{SCONC}{Starting Concentrations at the beginning of the simulation} 
\item{CINACT}{Value that indicates an inactive value} 
\item{THKMIN}{Minimum saturated thickness in a cell}
\item{IFMTCN}{Flag indicating whether the calculated concentration should be 
printed to the standard output text file and also serves as a printing-format
code if it is printed}
\item{IFMTNP}{Flag indicating if the number of particles in each cell should be printed and also
serves as a printing format code if it is printed}
\item{IFMTRF}{Flag indicating if the model-calculated retardation factor should be printed and also
serves as a printing format code if it is printed}
\item{IFMTDP}{Flag indicating if the model-calculated distance-weighted dispersion coefficient should
be printed and also serves as a printing format code if it is printed} 
\item{SAVUCN}{Logical flag indicating if the concentration solution should be saved to a .ucn file}
\item{NPRS}{Flag indicating the frequncy of output and also indicating whether the frequency output
is specified in terms of total elapsed simulation time or the transport step number.
See MT3D Manual for further details of NPRS}
\item{TIMPRS}{Total elapsed time at which the simulation results are printed}

information should be printed}

should be recorded} 
\item{PERLEN}{Lengths of Stress Perids}
\item{NSTP}{Number of time-steps for the transient flow folution in each stress-period} 
\item{TSMULT}{Time-step multiplier. Only used if NSTP > 1. See MT3DMS Manual for 
further details} 
\item{TSLNGHdf}{If TSMULT < 0, TSLNGHdf frovides the length of time-steps for the
flow solution in each stress period}
\item{DT0}{The user-specified transport step size within each time-step of the
flow solution}

step of the flow solution}
\item{TTSMULT}{A multiplier for successive transport steps within a flow step}
